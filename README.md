# 👋 Hello, I'm Sumanth

I’m a builder of intelligent systems, explorer of emerging tech, and believer in clean, scalable code.  
I recently completed my **Master’s in Data Analytics (GPA: 3.85)** from **Saint Louis University**, where I specialized in **AI**, **MLOps**, and **data storytelling**.

I love turning complexity into clarity—whether it’s building autonomous agents, managing machine learning pipelines, or making data actually *talk*.

---

## 💡 What I Do

🧠 **AI Agent Architect**  
Build intelligent autonomous agents using tools like `LangChain`, `LangGraph`, `CrewAI`, and `AutoGen`.  
I’ve created agents that *think*, *retrieve*, and *act*—automating 85% of manual business workflows.

🔁 **MLOps Engineer**  
From notebooks to production: I design and deploy end-to-end ML pipelines using `MLflow`, `Kubeflow`, and `Azure ML`.  
Deployed robust, CI/CD-driven models with real-time drift detection.

📊 **Data Storyteller**  
Skilled in `SQL`, `PySpark`, `Power BI`, and `Python`—I extract insights and craft dashboards that support better decisions, not just prettier charts.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 📘 **Cognitive RAG (Graph-CoT)**
> A Chain-of-Thought reasoning engine layered over knowledge graphs, enabling dynamic multi-hop retrieval.
- Combines Neo4j + LLMs to think before retrieving.
- Used embedding + reasoning loops to improve relevance.
- Reduced hallucinations by pruning irrelevant subgraphs.

### 🤖 **Customer Service AI Agent**
> Built an autonomous RAG-powered agent that cut average response time by 70%.
- Powered by GPT-4, LangGraph, and vector DBs like FAISS.
- Handles retrieval, reasoning, and multistep decision flows.

### 🧠 **Multi-Agent Data Pipeline**
> Designed a multi-agent system to automate analytics workflows.
- CrewAI + AutoGen + Airflow for orchestrated, intelligent task division.
- Integrated with APIs for real-world data ingestion.
